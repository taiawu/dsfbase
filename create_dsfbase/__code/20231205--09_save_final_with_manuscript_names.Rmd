Generate data files with the file names used in the final submission

This step done programmatically to streamline updating of these files
as well as to disambiguate naming/versioning

```{r}
#library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
```

Create the "for final manuscript" folder
```{r}
fs::dir_create("../__final_files_for_submission/dsfbase/") # actual dsfbase csvs
fs::dir_create("../__final_files_for_submission/supplemental_data/") # SI
```

DSFbase
```{r}
dir_copy(path = "../03_final_dsfbase/csvs",
         new_path = "../__final_files_for_submission/dsfbase/",
         overwrite = TRUE)
```

Data S1: detailed experimental conditions
```{r}
file_copy(path = "../03_final_dsfbase/experimental_conditions/dsfbase_experimental_conditions.csv",
         new_path = "../__final_files_for_submission/supplemental_data/Data_S1_experimental_conditions.csv")
```

Data S2: Subset and sub-subset assignments for all entries in DSFbase by ID. 
```{r}
file_copy(path = "../03_final_dsfbase/dsfbase_subset_assignments.csv",
         new_path = "../__final_files_for_submission/supplemental_data/Data_S2_subset_assignments_by_id.csv")
```
